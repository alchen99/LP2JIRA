# LP2JIRA (LaunchPad to JIRA)

## Description

These are scripts for migrating the open source project Trafodion's bugs and blueprints from LaunchPad to Apache JIRA.

## Scripts

  * The Python script **LaunchpadBugs.py** extracts the bugs' and blueprints' information from LaunchPad using LaunchPad's Python API
    and creates and XML document for each bug and blueprint.
  * The C# program **JiraCSV.exe** converts the XML documents generated by LaunchpadBugs.py to a CSV file for importing into JIRA

## Using the Scripts

  * In LaunchpadBugs.py change the definition of the following :
    * Line 17 CONST_TEAM (replace with your LaunchPad project name)
  * In Program.cs change the definitions of following and recompile :
    * Line 23 jiraBaseURL
	* Line 25 localBugsDirectory
	* Line 27 attachmentsTempURL
	* Line 30 nameMappingFile
	* Line 32 jiraProjectName
	* Line 34 jiraProjectKey
	* Line 36 jiraTempUser
	* Line 38 bpStartNumber
	* Line 305, 315 replace **trafodion** with your LaunchPad project name
  
## Known Issues

All Blueprints do not get extracted from LaunchPad.  The LaunchPad API returns a URL that does not return all Blueprints.
